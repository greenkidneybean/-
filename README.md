## STATUS: moving data from /ChambersPhotoHome to /Magnolia, probably need to reformat drive for OMV
- use existing ext4 format for the SSD
- create 1TB sparse image for the photos library (will expand as data added)
- trying to rename the disk device name
  - Device: ChambersPhoto
  - Mount point: /ChambersPhotoHome (this has all the data)
  - there is also /Magnolia

## Build Guide:
- Download Raspberry Pi imager
- 

## Mounting drive on unix
- `mount -t ext4` to list the ext4 drives available
- `sudo mount /dev/sda1 /media` to mount the disk to the root media directory
